    <h2>Staff have been paged</h2>
    <p>You requested assistance from staff. They should contact you soon. </p><p>If this is (or becomes) an <strong>EMERGENCY</strong> situation, click the PAGE link on the left and page SUICIDE IN PROGRESS. Remember to use the checklist to help assess lethality if you are talking with someone who is in a severe crisis situation.</p>
    <p><b>If you have paged Staff for help, they will attempt to call the Agora office line, pick up the office phone so that Staff  manages to make contact with you and can let you know they are on their way. If your shift partner is there have them pick it up and talk to the Crisis Support Team. If you are alone pick up the office line and continue talking to the caller, we will be able to understand by that, that you can not talk to us but need help.</b></p>
